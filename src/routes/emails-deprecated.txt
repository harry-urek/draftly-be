This file contains the old email routes implementation that directly uses the lib/gmail.js module.
These routes have been replaced with the new EmailController that follows the proper layered architecture.

The new implementation:
1. Uses EmailController in src/controllers/EmailController.ts
2. Which depends on EmailService in src/services/EmailService.ts
3. Which uses GmailIntegration in src/integrations/GmailIntegration.ts

This provides better separation of concerns and testability.

DO NOT USE THIS FILE. It is kept for historical reference only.
